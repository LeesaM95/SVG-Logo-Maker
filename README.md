# SVG-Logo-Maker
 
## Description
The SVG-Logo-Maker application allows a user to quickly and easily create a simple logo for whatever they need using only a couple of prompts. 

## Visuals
As this program runs strictly through terminal, I've attached a short video demonstrating how the application works.

## Installation
This application was made through Node.js. As such, Node must be installed on to your device, and the application run through a terminal. Clone the repository on to your device, then, after opening the repository in your preferred visual coding application, open a terminal via the **main folder** of the application, and run an `npm install` to install the packages needed to make the application run. Once the packages have been installed, input the commans `node index.js` to begin the query prompts that will help create a simple logo. 

## Testing
This application does indeed come with a test.js file to make sure it's working properly. Make sure that you've done the `npm install` into your terminal of the main folder of the repository, then simply run the command `npm test` to run the test script. If it all returns as 'passed', feel free to immediately use the `node index.js` command to create a simple logo. 

## Support

## Acknowledgements
I had a bit of a hard time figuring out where to start with this one, so I'd like to thank <a href="https://github.com/catxcoding">Cat Thompson</a> on GitHub and <a href="https://github.com/gurleyryan">Ryan Gurley</a> on GitHub for their amazing repositories. Referencing them helped me out a lot in figuring out where I went wrong and why my code was bugging out something fierce. I appreciate their clean, well thought-out codes and commentary. Without these kinds of guides, I'd be drowning in bog water trying to figure out what to do.
